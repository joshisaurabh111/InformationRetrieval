Compile the code using :

javac -cp .:commons-csv-1.5.jar:jsoup-1.11.2.jar sjoshi11_java_part3/*.java

Run the code using below format of input :

javac -cp .:commons-csv-1.5.jar:jsoup-1.11.2.jar sjoshi11_java_part3/assignmentP3 "/home/sourabh/Desktop/IR/project/part2/Reviews" dict.csv post.csv table.csv output.txt

Please prove "" outside the first argument since it takes a path.
Let the other arguments be .csv files since the code is supposed to create comma seperated values.


External library used :

Jsoup library : 
jsoup-1.11.2.jar file is included in the submission.

Apache-Commons library :
commons-csv-1.5  file used for writing and reading CSV files.


Without compiling this file the code will not run.
